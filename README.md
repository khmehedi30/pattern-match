# pattern-match
To solve this problem, just used simple for loop. As we know in PHP we access a string like an array. Iterate through the text from the beginning to the position where the remaining characters can still accommodate the pattern. For each position i, extract a substring of the text starting at position i with a length equal to the pattern's length. Compare the extracted substring with the provided pattern. If the substring matches the pattern, increment the count variable.
